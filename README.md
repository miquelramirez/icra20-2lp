## Python packages needed

All latest versions:

 - `numpy`
 - `pandas`

## Instructions to download experimental data

### Unicycle

Use this [Dropbox link](https://www.dropbox.com/sh/hxznqjj9d34ppfd/AAD6b3IeeClPOwlK9y5gBclYa?dl=0)
to download the files

 - `experimental-results-1209.tar.bz2`
 - `experimental-results-1209-1.tar.bz2`

Then you should unpack them into the folder `results/unicycle/data`. Once unpacked
they will take approximately 2.5 GBytes of space.
